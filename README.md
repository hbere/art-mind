# ArtMIND Description
We are grateful for the opportunity to participate in the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA) Hackathon 3.0 and create ArtMIND (more info @ https://devpost.com/software/artmind), a web application that looks great on mobile devices and is designed to help PMA members and visitors connect more deeply with the art. Making ArtMIND was a new experience for our team, and we came together. We wrote recommendation algorithms and a web application prototype (code @ https://github.com/sowmya1016/art-mind) that allows the user to log in; view and register "like"-style opinions 10 pieces or art from selected galleries across the PMA collection, chosen by hand or randomly; and receive recommendations for additional PMA artworks to visit. With ArtMIND, visitors to the Philadelphia Museum of Art can view art from a dozen galleries on their phone the moment they walk in the door, discover a piece they like, and know where to go to see it in person.
